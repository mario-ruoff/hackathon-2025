# Progress

- Completed: Memory Bank initialized; `data/README.md` documents dataset usage plus load/CRS steps; added `tools/quick_view.py` for CRS summaries, static plotting with optional orthophoto mosaic, handling tiles without embedded CRS, and folium HTML export with sanitized attributes and non-deprecated centering.
- In progress: None.
- Pending:
  - Gather detailed requirements/goals for the hackathon solution.
  - Analyze datasets to document schema, CRS, and potential use cases.
  - Choose tech stack and create project setup once objectives are defined.
- Risks/unknowns: Lack of clarity on deliverables, timelines, and technical constraints.
